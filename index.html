    <center><h1>CHARLIE CHAPLIN</h1>
        <img src="./image1.jpg" alt="">
        <p><i><b>Charles Spencer Chaplin</b> was born in London, England, on April 16th, 1889. His father was a versatile vocalist and actor; and his mother, known under the stage name of Lily Harley, was an attractive <b>actress</b> and <b>singer</b>, who gained a reputation for her work in the light opera field.

            Charlie was thrown on his own resources before he reached the age of ten as the early death of his father and the subsequent illness of his mother made it necessary for Charlie and his brother, Sydney, to fend for themselves.</i></p>

        <p><i>        
            When he was about <b> twelve</b>, he got his first chance to act in a legitimate stage show, and appeared as <b> “Billy”</b> the page boy, in support of first <b> H.A.Saintsbury</b> and then William Gillette in different productions of “Sherlock Holmes”. At the close of this engagement, Charlie started a career as a comedian in vaudeville, which eventually took him to the United States in 1910 as a featured player with the Fred Karno. He scored an immediate hit with American audiences, particularly with his characterization in a sketch entitled <b>“A Night in an English Music Hall”</b>. When the Fred Karno troupe returned to the United States in the fall of 1912 for a repeat tour, Chaplin was offered a motion picture contract.

            <p><h3>He finally agreed to appear before the cameras at the expiration of his vaudeville commitments in November 1913; and his entrance in the cinema world took place that month when he joined Mack Sennett and the Keystone Film Company. His initial salary was $150 a week, but his overnight success on the screen spurred other producers to start negotiations for his services.</h3></b></p>

    <br><h1>Young Performer :-</h1>
    
       <ul> <i>
           <li> Between his time in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, <b> Chaplin began to perform on stage.</b></li>
           <br><li> He later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from <b> Hannah one night in Aldershot</b>.</li>
           <br><li> This was an isolated occurrence, but by the time he was nine Chaplin had, with his mother's encouragement, grown interested in performing.</li>
           <br><li> He later wrote: <b> "she imbued me with the feeling that I had some sort of talent".</b></li>
           <br><li> Through his father's connections, Chaplin became a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout <b> 1899</b> and <b> 1900.</b></li>
           <br><li> Chaplin worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a <b> comedy act.</b></li>
        </i></ul>

    <h1> Entering Films(1914–1917) :-</h1>
    <ul><i>
        
        <li>Six months into the second American tour, Chaplin was invited to join the <b> New York Motion Picture Company</b>. A representative who had seen his performances thought he could replace Fred Mace, a star of their Keystone Studios who intended to leave.</li>
        <br><li>Chaplin thought the Keystone comedies <b> "a crude mélange of rough and rumble"</b>, but liked the idea of working in films and rationalised : "Besides, it would mean a new life.</li>
        <br><br><center><img src="./image5.jpg" alt="" width="450"></center><br><br>
        
        <li>Chaplin's boss was Mack Sennett, who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young. He was not used in a picture until late January, during which time Chaplin attempted to learn the processes of <b> filmmaking.</b></li>
        <br><li>The film was <b>Mabel's Strange Predicament</b>, but <b> "the Tramp"</b> character, as it became known, debuted to audiences in Kid Auto Races at Venice – shot later than Mabel's Strange Predicament but released two days earlier on 7 February 1914.</li>

    <ul><h1>Charlie Chaplin’s Scandalous Life and Boundless Artistry :-</h1><br>
    <ul><i>
        <li>The most un-put-downable movie book of the season is also the most un-pick-uppable one: <b> “The Charlie Chaplin Archives”</b> (Taschen), which is the size of a small suitcase and weighs in at fourteen pounds, packed tightly with five hundred and sixty pages’ worth of thick and glossy paper bearing a treasure trove of superbly printed images alongside a relentlessly fascinating collage-like textual biography of Chaplin. It’s an apt tribute to the filmmaker, whose artistry transcends the cinema and spans world-historical dimensions.</li><br>
        <li>The book’s editor, <b> Paul Duncan</b>, who also wrote or co-wrote ten of its fifteen chapters, states his aim in the first line of his introduction— <b> “to show you how Charlie Chaplin made his films”</b> and he has access to an extraordinary trove of documents for the reconstruction, <b> “preserved thanks to Charlie’s half brothers Sydney Chaplin and Wheeler Dryden.”</b></li><br><br>
       <center> <img src="./image7.jpg" alt="" align="left" width="280"><img src="./image6.jpg" width="400" alt=""><img src="./image7.jpg" alt="" align="right" width="280"></center>
        <br><li>The Chaplin family made these materials available to Duncan and his collaborators, but their involvement doesn’t seem to have inflected the substance of the book, which also ranges widely through Chaplin’s private life, including its lurid, scandalous, and criminal byways.</li><br>
        <li>The rodomontade was, <b>Laurel</b> saw, a gag, but the essence of its truth was soon realized. In <b>1913</b>, in <b>Philadelphia</b>, the company manager received a fateful telegram from representatives of Mack Sennett’s Keystone Studios: <b> “Is there a man named Chaffin in your company or something like that”</b>.</li><br>
